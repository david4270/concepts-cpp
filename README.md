# **concepts-cpp: C++ practice**
PEY is a great time to bring back my unused skills - so I've decided to work on C++, and some more stuff. Seems like first-year level lab? Well, better re-start late than never!

Project topics can be changed in planning stage.

**[WIP]** - working in progress

**[planned]** - planned exercise

[need details] - will be updated with details

## **Basic**
Folders with 'basic' prefix have micro projects with basic C++ concepts and practices. Used concepts from second year introductory programming course (ECE244).

**_basic-1_**: calculate two doubles

**_basic-2_**: basic introduction to classes

**_basic-3_**: calculator using stringstream

**_basic-4_**: classes which are connecting each other like linked lists - personal information

**_basic-5_**: operator overloading with complex number

**_basic-6_**: recursive sorting algorithm(s)

**_basic-7_**: binary search tree of numbers **[WIP]**

basic-8: inheritance **[planned]**[need details]

basic-9: hash table **[planned]**[need details]

## **Intermediate**
Folders with 'intermediate' prefix have mini projects with intermediate C++ concepts and practices.

intermediate-1: inheritance project **[planned]**[need details]

## **Project**
Folders with resume-level projects. Might make separated repository for each project. Will be updated once I feel like I am prepared enough to initiate project, and have some project idea.
